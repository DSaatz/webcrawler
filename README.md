# Webcrawler

This project is a simple web crawler implemented in Python. It was inspired by [@afazio1](https://github.com/afazio1), who presented their own web crawler in a YouTube video.  

In contrast to their implementation, this version was created in Python with the goal of getting familiar with the Python ecosystem in preparation for future Python-heavy projects.  

## Goals & Focus

The main focus of this project is to:  
- Explore and learn the use of Python libraries such as [Beautiful Soup (bs4)](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and others.  
- Build and expand on data analysis logic based on crawled data.  
- Lay the groundwork for future features, such as:
  - A custom web crawler implementation.
  - A UI for easier interaction.
  - Containerizing the app for simplified deployment and usage.

## Current State

At the moment, the project uses Beautiful Soup for parsing, but a custom crawling mechanism might be added later to gain more control over the scraping and data processing pipeline.  

## Setup

_TBD_
